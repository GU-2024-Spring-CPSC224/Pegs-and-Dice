# CPSC 224 Final Project: Pegs & Dice

### Project Description:

Pegs & Dice is a strategic board game where players aim to move pegs into specific positions within a 5 x 12 grid by utilizing the outcomes of two dice rolls. Each player takes turns rolling the dice and strategically setting up combos to move their pegs to their upmost position. You can re-roll unused dice, but you can only use the re-rolls if itâ€™s the same result of the original combo. Pegs are moved forwards based on how many combinations of two dice equal the wanted result. The goal is to position all twelve pegs at the top level of the board in order to win!
